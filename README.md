# Krisp
A multipurpose 2D game and physics engine written in Kotlin
Krisp is still very much a work in progress. A list of todo's can be found down below.

- [x] Event system
- [x] Task system
- [x] Game Logic handling and updating (GameLoop)
- [x] Shader support

## Todo
- [ ] ECS (Entity Component System) based game logic and rendering
- [ ] Physics engine
- [ ] Font Rendering (Currently only supports bitmap fonts, but I want to add support for TTF fonts)
- [ ] Audio
- [ ] Networking, both client and server, with a simple API for communications using a Packet based approach
- [ ] A simple GUI system
- [ ] Sprite rendering
- [ ] Tilemap rendering
- [ ] Support for headless servers and clients (No window rendering, only logic and physics and a way to retrieve the pixel data of the rendered scene)
